# Stripe Follow Along Dropdown

"Stripe Follow Along Dropdown" project as a part of the JavaScript 30 Challenge by Wes Bos.

The project involves creating a dropdown menu that appears to "follow along" with the mouse as it hovers over the different options. When a user hovers over a menu item, a panel should slide down from underneath it and expand to cover the width of the menu. The panel should also have a background color that matches the background color of the menu item.
